* Drank Red Bull so that she could stay up to look at a breach
* Sharks have brought her to New Zealand

* TV Sharks
  * Assumed to be male, but people don't look for the clasp spurs
  * Teenage Melissa got angry with talking male sharks, not because
    they were talking, but because they didn't have clasp spurs

* Academia
  * Peers, mentors, professors were all male
  * When working with sharks to put something into them, asked "What can
    I do to get stronger?", told to "leave it to the males"
  * Now there are lots of females

* Some shark pups only had their mother's DNA
  * Took reproduction into their own fins

* Meaghen McCord: working with bull shark in South Africa
  * Megan was 6-months pregnant; shark was also pregnant

* Female sharks are larger than males

* Female humans have to deal with things that males don't have to deal with

  * it was on a boat, in the middle of a storm, with the other crew members sick
  * it didn't end well

* Sex: male sharks need to bite the females for the act
  * females have 3-times thicker skin where the males bite

* Female humans also have thick skins
  * females are most typically followed [on social media] due to appearance alone
  * 74% of females said their appearance was criticised before their work

* There are no female marine biologist role models... that's a problem
  * Melissa wished for role models when she was 7 years old
  * She is now 23 years old, but advocates for diverse sharks and
  diverse role models via the fins united initiative
  * Female voices are absent from the marine biologist field
  * Don't let women researchers be ignored; shine a light: we're here
