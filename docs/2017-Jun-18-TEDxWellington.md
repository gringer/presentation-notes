  completely changed his life

## Audience Speakers, block 2

* Sam
  * 10 years ago on a plane trip, a man was playing angry birds next to him

## Clare Christian

* The galip nut -- oil, roast, or eat raw
* 8 million hectares, growing at the rate of 2 trees per hectare across Melanesia
* Found in naturally-ocurring rainforest, resitstant to [rainforest] diseases and pests
* Clare is exploring the potential of the sustainable commercialisation of the nut

* Where it all started: 5 years ago with a medical checkup
  * Instead of statin drugs, talked to a homeopath who suggested trying to eliminate grain from her diet
  * Energy increased, she lost weight
  * Hip pain was gone
  * Could handle losing the pasta and rice, but not eggs and honey on toast

* Clare tried developing a grain-free bread that didn't fall apart in
  the toaster
  * friend: "You've invented paleo-bread"
  * commonsense organics loved it, people all over the country loved it
  * For three years, bread was distributed throughout New Zealand
  * However, number one source was almond meal, which was getting expensive
  * Needed to find an alternative to almonds
  * Her son, Gabriel Davidson (from the Wellington Chocolate Factory)
    suggested using the galip nut instead
  * Bread was better than expected: tasted better

* Lightbulb moment: what about sustainable harvesting of the galip nut
  * Two more were added to the team of two
  * Nut has a taste somewhere between macadamia, pine, and almond
  * Until now [i.e. TEDxWellington], only a handful of people have
    tried it outside Melanesia
  * Met with a whole bunch of people; wanted to understand how
    villagers felt about the project
  * Headed home with a very positive response and 40kg of galip nuts

* Several opportunities for the team
  * Meaningful, ethical employment
  * Protect rainforest from loggin
  * Provide for a fast-growing consumer market
  * Market seems very willing
    * Every retailer they talked to was on board
    * A global cosmetics compary is keen on the oil, and wants
    exclusivity depending on test results

* Almonds and galip nuts have similarities, but not so similar in
  sustainability
  * Californian almond industry needs 3.5 litres to grow one almond
    nut to maturity
  * Trees have 1,000 nuts per harvest, so 3500 litres of water (vs
    galip nuts, which bring their own rain)
  * Almond growers are drilling wells for water
  * So much water is being pulled out of California that the land is sinking
  * River levels are lowering, water temperatures are rising, native
    salmon are dying
  * Galip has the potential to offer the world an alternative to almonds

* Current aim: solar processing plant to supply the New Zealand industry
  * If successful, will develop a larger commercial facility to
    sustain a larger world supply

## Phil Sage

* Toys can unlock the leaders of the future

* Play-doh: the ultimate creativity tool
  * "observing Mum & Dad picking it out of the carpet"
  * What would it feel like to moonshot it into the future?
  * Can take creations into a digital environment
  * Sparkles of innovation lead you to a digital dough can
  * Can shift physical object into a digital world

* Phil's grandfather
  * rail building was in disrepair for 35 years
  * converted into family home, staring with no building experience
  * built a fish & chip shop
  * invested in a plot of land to deal with shellfish
  * handed land/business off to grandson, but Phil had other ideas
    * "It's all here as and when you need it"
  * Can build journeys for other people
  * Phil's grandfather was his pace car

* Magic The Gathering
  * Collectible strategy card game with fantasy story and (??)
  * What if ideas could be taken through to other areas?
  * DropMix: collectible card game for music production
    * No need to be a superstar DJ
    * Perfect synchronisation, no matter what the beats per minute, etc.

* Goethe quote: If I accept you as you are, I will make you worse;
  however, if I treat you as though you are what you are capable of
  becoming, I help you become that

* If we lead our children into the world with the highest degree of
  creativity, we are able to unlock the unknown

## Melissa Cristina-Marquez

* Drank Red Bull so that she could stay up to look at a breach
* Sharks have brought her to New Zealand

* TV Sharks
  * Assumed to be male, but people don't look for the clasp spurs
  * Teenage Melissa got angry with talking male sharks, not because
    they were talking, but because they didn't have clasp spurs

* Academia
  * Peers, mentors, professors were all male
  * When working with sharks to put something into them, asked "What can
    I do to get stronger?", told to "leave it to the males"
  * Now there are lots of females

* Some shark pups only had their mother's DNA
  * Took reproduction into their own fins

* Meaghen McCord: working with bull shark in South Africa
  * Megan was 6-months pregnant; shark was also pregnant

* Female sharks are larger than males

* Female humans have to deal with things that males don't have to deal with

* As a 48kg 5'1" woman, was aksed to pick up an anchor half her size and weight
  * it was on a boat, in the middle of a storm, with the other crew
    members sick
  * it didn't end well

* Sex: male sharks need to bite the females for the act
  * females have 3-times thicker skin where the males bite

* Female humans also have thick skins
  * females are most typically followed [on social media] due to
    appearance alone
  * 74% of females said their appearance was criticised before their work

* There are no female marine biologist role models... that's a problem
  * Melissa wished for role models when she was 7 years old
  * She is now 23 years old, but advocates for diverse sharks and
  diverse role models via the fins united initiative
  * Female voices are absent from the marine biologist field
  * Don't let women researchers be ignored; shine a light: we're here
